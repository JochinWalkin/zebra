code for printing barcode labels with a zebra printer

ZEBRA printers.  A fancy name for printing stripes.
                 A good way to print barcode labels.
                 
This code was developed before QPC was avaliable  The project fell apart partially due to staff members with an elevated 
feeling of "If it aint Oracle, then it aint worth their time."   

The file, "PrintYourName.pl" generates 4 labels with your name + barcode of your name:
1.  One label displays your name and barcode of your name horizontally at top.
2.  Same as #1 with dislay in center of of the  label.
3.  Same as #1 with label dislayed vertrically at the side.
4.  Same as #3 with label centered vertically.
